### lanshare
 
 lanshare is a thing that allows you to send files via lan. 
 
 ### Quick start
 
1. run npm install
2. run node .
3. go to the address that was logged in console
4. voilà 

you can connect to this address from any device connected to your local network

files that you send are stored on a computer that you ran a node . command in a directory called ./images

since its impossible to push empty folders on github, i added a placeholder image - you can delete it after you download
